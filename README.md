Hey there, here is a little introduction to my profile.
I'm a teen french developer making things sometimes on Github. Some of my work is in private so you may not see it in my repos, but it shows up in my contributions count.

### Little story of my dev life

Years ago, I accidentally discovered we could create Discord bots. So I decided to learn [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) and create my first bot. I finally created [Morpy](https://github.com/morpybot) in 2019, a minigames bot, and still today it works. When I write these lines, it has more than 1000 servers and about 100,000 played games. By the way, Morpy is verified.

Also, I started to learn Java (to make Minecraft plugins), React, TS but never finished these learnings (also I didn't really had any use case for these languages lol).
Though I know SQL and a bit of C++.

### About Morpy

Today, Morpy is functional, but I don't really work on new stuff about it. It's a kind of "ghost project", it works by itself without needing me to update or fix things. The project is on Github on a private repo, but I have sometimes asked myself if I should make it public.

### Other stuff

I'd say that I'm quite experienced in Javascript, but I stay an amateur. really. The image below shows an interesting view of the Dunning-Kruger effect, the overestimation of skills by begginers in a new subject. Btw, this is a "satiric" point of vue of the study, but the effect really exists.
